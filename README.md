==========================================================================>> templates <<================
```
Welcome to the **rabbit hole**. This is a living archive of custom Nuclei templates — everything from practical attack surface coverage to weird research experiments that may or may not ever find a bug. Some of these templates earned real bounties, others are pure chaos in YAML form.  

## Why release them?  
Because security belongs to everyone, and knowledge rotting in private repos helps no one. These templates are free, open, and yours to break, improve, and abuse (responsibly).

### ✅ What You’ll Find Here  
 • Real-world bounty hitters: Templates that flagged vulnerabilities and paid off.  
 • Work-in-progress concepts: Some unfinished ideas — think of them as exploit fan-fiction that might become reality.  
 • Research probes: Purely experimental stuff. Use at your own risk, and don’t cry if it returns nothing.  
 • Emerging tech coverage: Cloud-native, AI/ML pipelines, OAuth edge cases, extension isolation bypass — the blind spots we all should care about.  

### ⚠️ Disclaimers  
 • These templates come as-is. No promises, no guarantees, no refunds.  
 • Some may trigger false positives. Some may do absolutely nothing. Others might burn down your staging env if you’re careless.  
 • Use them for legal and educational purposes only. Don’t be a skid.  
 • By using these templates, you agree that you’re the adult in the room. If you break something, that’s on you.  

### 🛠 Contributing  
 • Found a bug? Open an issue.  
 • Got a killer template idea? Drop a pull request.  
 • Want to make these better? Fork, hack, repeat.  
 • Sponsorships welcome — if this repo saves you time or earns you money, consider buying us a coffee (or a GPU).  

## ⚡ Pro Tip  
The Nuclei ecosystem thrives on community. The more we share, the harder we make it for bad actors to hide in plain sight.
